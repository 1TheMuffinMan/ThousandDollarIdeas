ThousandDollarIdeas
===================

Instead of one big, good idea to make a lot of money... a bunch of poor, small ideas to make a little money. I take pull requests.

 - **KennelFinder.com**
  
   KennelFinder never really went anywhere. I don't own it any more, having given it to friends, but could still work on it. They've agreed to let me open source the code. I'm going to rewrite with Nancy and show off some CQRS+ES+DDD concepts.

  The site ended up being a use-it-once-and-done site. There's no stickiness. One option could be to extend it with boarding management. This would shift focus to vets and kennels as primary customers. Maybe pivot to helping them maintain an online presence.

 - **Michigan T-Shirt**
  
   Everyone that sees the t-shirt my wife and I made for the Hyrman family reunion wants one... even though it's family-specific. The design would be easy enough to re-appropriate, with a bit of work, to something more generic but Michigan themed. 
 
 - **Garden Journal**
  
   There are starting to be more apps in this space, but a way to quickly catalog what you've planted, when, how it went, and help you plan out upcoming tasks would be very useful. A lot of it could be triggered off of your specific growing seasons and help with things that always suck for small-time gardeners, like succession planting schedules.

  This would be a good app for an open source implementation on Nancy.

 - **Reading Journal**
  
 Just for the oss work... simple app to let you track and rate what you've read, books on loan to people, etc. Could be another showcase for some DDD work (simple domain, time-based intransients like book on loan). Nancy would be perfect for this. Yes, GoodReads exists, but, hey.

 - **Jubilee**
 
  Help with https://github.com/pgermishuys/Jubilee because I want to because I think it's got some great promise and also becasue @pgermishuys is an all-around nice guy.

  I'm especially keen on if there's a compelling story with ScriptCS. Oh, and generally making the end-user's experience with Jubilee fun and as painless as possible.
